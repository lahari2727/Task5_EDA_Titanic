
Objective: The goal of this task was to extract meaningful insights from the Titanic dataset by performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The analysis was conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.



Steps Taken:

1.Data Overview: to explore the dataset and get an understanding of the features.

2.Univariate Analysis: Examined individual variables like 'Age', 'Fare', 'Survived', 'Sex, and 'Passenger_class'.

3.Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Investigated relationships between survival and features like Sex, Age, and 'Passenger_class' using visualizations like boxplots and 'pairplots'.

4.Correlation Heatmap: Analyzed the correlation between numerical features to understand the relationships.

5.Summary of Findings: Summarized key insights from the visualizations, identifying trends and patterns in the data.


Tools Used:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and heatmaps.


Insights:
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive compared to those in 3rd class.
- Younger passengers had a better chance of survival.
- Fare and passenger class were strongly correlated.



Conclusion:
This task helped improve my skills in data analysis, visualization, and identifying patterns and trends in data. The insights gained from this task will be useful in understanding passenger survival on the Titanic.
